ofxTextSuite
============

Openframeworks Text Manipulation Suite
Formed from [lukemalcolm's](https://github.com/lukemalcolm) original [version](https://github.com/lukemalcolm/ofxTextSuite).

I updated this for iOS and includes keyboard interaction. The example is super basic, but it's a start.

This version makes use of my forked version of armadillu's [ofxRetinaTrueTypeFont](https://github.com/armadillu/ofxRetinaTrueTypeFont) which you can get [here](https://github.com/armadillu/ofxRetinaTrueTypeFont). Be sure to download and add to your addons folder as well.
