ofxTextSuite
============

Openframeworks Text Manipulation Suite

I updated this version for iOS and includes keyboard interaction. The example is super basic, but it's a start.

This version makes use of armadillu's [ofxRetinaTrueTypeFont](https://github.com/armadillu/ofxRetinaTrueTypeFont), so be sure to download and add to your addons folder.
